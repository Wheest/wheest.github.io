Awright!  I'm Perry Gibson, Student of Informatics, studying for a PhD in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow supervised by [Dr Jos√© Cano Reyes](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/).  I work at the intersection of machine learning and systems.

I'm interested in across-stack optimisation of neural networks, especially on constrained edge-devices, with a focus on what compiler toolchains like [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) and [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) can bring.

You can find some of my [published work  here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bf-bR_UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
For non-academic publications, I have a [machine generated poetry book](https://gibsonic.org/nlp/2020/01/30/robot_burns.html) inspired by the works of Rabbie Burnsü•Éüê≠üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø, and helped produce an [AI Generated music video](https://gibsonic.org/side-projects/2021/11/19/music_video.html) (_just_ before it was cool üòé).

In 2019 I did a [research visit](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/perry-gibson/) at the [Barcelona Super Computing Centre](https://www.bsc.es), through the [PRACE Summer of HPC](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/perry-gibson/) program.
There, I explored optimized data placement in heterogeneous memory systems, as well as how to make more reproducible experimental workflows.
In 2022 I undertook a research visit to Northeastern university, exploring MLIR and homomorphic encryption.

I'm at home in the shell, and manage a suite of self- and cloud-hosted services.
I like my workflows to be reproducible, through containerisation, or environment managers.

You can read more about my work on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-gibson/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Wheest), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bf-bR_UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts).

Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss opportunities or such.
