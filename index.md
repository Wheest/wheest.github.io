Awright!? I'm Perry Gibson, working at the intersection of machine learning📉
and systems🔩.<br>

I currently work at [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/) as a Member of
Technical Staff, with a focus on ML Compilers.

In 2024 I completed a PhD at the [gicLAB](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/)
([University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/)), supervised
by [Dr José Cano Reyes](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/).

I believe that compilers are a key technology for bridging the gap between
high-level application code and efficient hardware execution. Domain-specific
compilers like [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), or frameworks for building
them, like [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) are increasingly important in today's
commercial and research landscape.

Compilers also have an important place in
[the era of accelerated, application focused hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA5pqklkkvI),
both in their design, and for code generation. That's why I'm at Fractile!

In my PhD, I explored across-stack optimisation of deep neural networks, with a
compiler-centric perspective.
