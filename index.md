Awright!  I'm Perry Gibson, working at the intersection of machine learningðŸ“‰ and systemsðŸ”©.<br>   I'm completing a PhD at the [gicLAB](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) ([University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/)), supervised by [Dr JosÃ© Cano Reyes](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/).

I'm interested in across-stack optimisation of neural networks, especially on constrained edge-devices, with a focus on what compiler toolchains like [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) and [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) can bring.

You can find some of my research work under [Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications).
For non-academic publications, I have a [machine generated poetry book]({{ site.baseurl }}//nlp/2020/01/30/robot_burns.html) inspired by the works of Rabbie Burns (2020), an [AI Generated music video](https://gibsonic.org/side-projects/2021/11/19/music_video.html) (2021), and a [web-based follow-up to Robot Burns]({{ site.baseurl }}/https://gibsonic.org/blog/2023/01/25/robot_burns_infinite.html) (2023).

I've undertaken research visits at the [Barcelona Super Computing Centre](https://www.bsc.es) (2019, through the [PRACE Summer of HPC](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/perry-gibson/) program) investigating optimized data placement in heterogeneous memory systems; and Northeastern University (2022), exploring MLIR and homomorphic encryption.

I'm at home in the shell, and manage a suite of self- and cloud-hosted services.
I like my workflows to be reproducible, through containerisation, template systems (like [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), or environment managers.

You can read more about my work on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-gibson/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Wheest), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bf-bR_UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts).

Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss my work, opportunities, or such.
