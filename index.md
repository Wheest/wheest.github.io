Awright!?  I'm Perry Gibson, working at the intersection of machine learningðŸ“‰ and systemsðŸ”©.<br>
I currently work at [Fractile](https://www.fractile.ai/) as an AI Compiler Engineer, and general busybody.
In 2024 I completed a PhD at the [gicLAB](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) ([University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/)), supervised by [Dr JosÃ© Cano Reyes](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/).

I'm interested in across-stack optimisation of neural networks, especially with a compiler-centric perspective. For example, [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), and tensor compilers in general. In fact, [that's what my PhD was all about](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/83959/)!

You can find some of my research work under [/Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications).
And other publications and posts under [/Posts]([/Publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts)), and open source contributions under [/oss]({{ site.baseurl }}/oss).

I've undertaken research visits at the [Barcelona Super Computing Centre](https://www.bsc.es) (2019, through the [PRACE Summer of HPC](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/perry-gibson/) program) investigating optimized data placement in heterogeneous memory systems; and [Northeastern University](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/) (2022, Boston, USA), exploring MLIR and homomorphic encryption.

I'm at home in the shell, and manage a suite of self- and cloud-hosted services.
I like my workflows to be reproducible: e.g., through containerisation, or template systems (like [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [AI Assets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09359)).  I try to learn from and educate my team members, and leave a trail of documentation like footprints.

You can read more about my work on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-gibson/), [GitHub](https://github.com/Wheest), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bf-bR_UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), or [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts).

Feel free to get in touch with me if you want to discuss my work, opportunities, or such.
