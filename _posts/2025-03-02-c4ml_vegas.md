I was chuffed to present at the [6th C4ML workshop](https://www.c4ml.org/) (Compilers for Machine Learning), at CGO 2025 in Las Vegas, NV, USA.

There, I presented "Rapid Compiler Prototyping using MLIR Python Bindings: A Case Study from Fractile".

This work was a case study on how we were able to leverage the MLIR Python bindings to quickly develop and iterate upon our initial compiler prototypes â€” all the way to compiling and correctly executing a realistic workload on our functional simulator.

Now we've moved further in our development process, but these early stages wouldn't have been as smooth without the tools and support of the MLIR and LLVM community.

Vegas was interesting.  I'm glad a city like that exists, but I'm also glad that not every city is like that.
It feels like everything is pretending to be something else.
