This conversation explores experiences in music journalism during the 1970s-80s,
focusing on work with New Musical Express (NME) and the development of
Scotland's music scene during the punk and post-punk era.

I speak with a former NME writer Glenn Gibson (aka, my da) about his experiences
breaking into music journalism, the evolution of music publications, and various
other bits and pieces.

**I've noticed you have interesting stories about both your experiences and
general knowledge of the music industry and related culture. I think it would be
good to get some snippets of them. As a starting point: you were doing some
music writing—how did you get into that?**

_It was the New Musical Express, which was well-established when I started._
_It's a music paper dating back to the 50s, and they were credited with
originating the UK pop charts. But it was very much tied_ _into the music
business. They just had pop stuff and so forth. And at some_ _point, during the
early 1970s, they got a new editor who totally_ _revamped it._

_Starting in the 60s there was the underground press which was usually
independent. And the NME started employing people who wrote for those
publications._

**So rather than just being a mouthpiece for what was coming out from the big
labels, it was able to give space for some more up-and-coming and challenging
artists?**

_Yes, rather than just covering what was in the charts. With the counterculture
and all of the post-war developments, music was developing fast._

_It went from rock and roll, to the Beatles, and the beat boom, and moved on to
prog rock, glam rock, and punk. Around 1976/77 they wanted music publications
that would reflect that — written by people who were close to the movement, who
were really part of that._

_And they were probably copying what was happening in America because in the
60s, Rolling Stone magazine started. Rolling Stone is now well-established, I
believe it's quite a corporate thing now. But it started as a counterculture
underground thing._

**They employed the likes of Hunter S. Thompson for articles?**

_Aye, actually mad people. One person they employed was Cameron Crowe, who went
on to become a film director. A film he wrote, 'Almost Famous,' was
semi-autobiographical._

**Auch aye, I think we watched that together a few years back.**

_He was just somebody who was a big music fan. And he sent them articles he'd
written, and they liked them. And I don't think they found out until later that
he was 15\. They were setting him off to interview big-time stars and he became
really successful. "Almost Famous" is arguably one of the best music business
films ever made. I would say that and "24 Hour Party People"._

_And Cameron Crowe has actually just published his autobiography, [“The Uncool”
(2025)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/224004354-the-uncool), because part
of “Almost Famous” was that he was never cool._

_Anyway, that's the kind of thing that the NME were trying to copy, and it
worked. They got a big audience and it became very cool, internationally as
well. It was very well liked in America too. They seemed open to taking on
people from around the country, so I went to see Ivor Cutler, the Scottish
humorist, singer, songwriter, and poet, and I wrote something about it and sent
it to them. They published it._

**Oh, crackin'**

_And they came back and said, would you like to do more? I sent them quite a few
things, and they didn't publish any of them. But then the person in charge of
the live review section changed and a new guy came in and he said, "Don't do
that anymore. What you should do is phone me every week and say what's coming up
and we will then commission you to write things." That's when I started getting
published — and paid._

_That being said, I still had a day job as well. Looking back, I don't know how
I managed it._

**I guess not having weans helps.**

_I think the extreme would be working all day and then going to Edinburgh and
not getting back home from Edinburgh until five in the morning. And then getting
up to go to work. Out constantly at gigs and interviews, and also needing the
time to write up._

**Aye, I can imagine doing it well would take a good chunk of time. Did you find
the acts you were being sent off to check out was aligning with your tastes, or
were you seeing a load of pish? Originally you were choosing what to write
about—once they started commissioning, were they selecting what you covered, or
were you still influencing the choices?**

_Well, a mixture, because I wasn't doing exclusively what was happening in
Scotland. I was being sent to review other bands who were touring who could be
American, but as well as covering what was happening in Scotland because what
was happening in Scotland was developing, and gaining national attention._

**Starting to develop its own scene?**

_Yes. Simple Minds was one of the first ones. I went to see them playing in
bars. I think they had already signed a contract with a record company at this
point, so they were starting to move beyond that, but there were a lot of other
ones coming up behind them._

**There are probably quite a lot of bands that people would be surprised to hear
came out of the Scottish scene because the accent or dialect doesn't necessarily
come across.**

_Well, the music business was always very centred in London. This was after
punk. One thing punk did was give people the message: “you can do it too.” And
what they were playing was relatively simple. That simplicity had origins in
early rock and roll. The British beat groups of the 1960s were actually quite
'punk' in their way—like The Who and The Animals, and Them. With Them, the
singer was Van Morrison who is still very successful._

_It was fairly simple, thus it's something that people who were just teaching
themselves how to play guitar or bass or drums could play. It was a reaction to
progressive rock, which can be very complicated and long and was all about
musicianship. That was a backlash against that. The impact of it was quite
startling._

**I guess there was starting to be more access to recording and distribution
equipment during that time?**

_There were local recording studios, but access to recording didn't change much
during that period. With computers and software it became much easier to record
from home, but you couldn't do that then really, unless you bought quite
expensive tape recorders, which could still be quite primitive. So bands would
go to record in small Scottish studios. But it could still cost a lot of money.
Some of them would be around £600 a day._

**Auch, geezo, and I guess that's £600 then as well.**

_For people without much money, that was a lot. And the Scottish bands who were
playing in bars would be paid very little. I think in some cases they'd get like
£10 and there might be four or five people in the band, and they had to hire a
van to get there which might cost them about £70 — so they were making a loss._
_But they were just trying to get their own music out there._

_It was an interesting dynamic but that message about "you can do it too" was
quite widespread. And more than just music. For instance, my friend Martin
Miller was very influenced by that ethos to become a writer. Actors, writers,
people across the creative arts—a lot of people were influenced by that, and
still are today._

_I got to do \[the writing\] for a number of years and earned a reasonable
amount of money and got to travel around and meet a lot of people. And with
various different publications, I probably did it for about 11 years. Although
you got some money, it was difficult to actually make a living._

**Because it was quite sporadic?**

_Yeah, it was unreliable, I was just a freelance person who was also working a
day job. There were some people who did the writing exclusively. However, they
were probably getting unemployment benefits and things like that, or there might
have been some other small local things that they did. There were a couple of
people who went on to write for the local newspapers, doing the pop column._

**Which is a bit more of a reliable income.**

_Yes, John Dingwall, for instance, he started off with a fanzine and then wrote
for Record Mirror, which was much less cool than the NME._

  <figcaption>Stand and Deliver, John Dingwall's fanzine</figcaption>
</figure>

_When he was just doing Record Mirror he probably wasn't getting that much, but
he went on working for the Daily Record and he did that for a long time. Making
money from journalism at that time, even if you were employed by even a Scottish
newspaper which was predominantly sold in Scotland, you were paid quite well.
The circulation of newspapers today has plummeted since then._

**Aye, the issues that face the entire journalism industry today is a whole
fraught topic unto itself.**

_I do know some people who moved to London and maybe had a bit of success. But
they weren't getting paid that much just working for music papers, or smaller
music magazines, they were very often living in cheap accommodation: squats,
somebody's spare room, or flats with only cold water and broken windows._

**I guess in a sense that's quite punk. You're getting an appreciation of your
source material.
**
_Right, the other side of that, is that the several people I can think of that
did that, they all died quite young. In their early 60s and some even younger._

**Is that what a lifetime of substandard heating will do to ye?**

_Yeah, and maybe not being able to feed themselves properly as well. It might be
a coincidence._

**People say the body keeps score.**

_Yes, I obviously have nothing definite about it but you know, it happened to
one photographer I worked with. He moved to London and got a job working for
"Sounds" which was quite a good magazine. It was not quite as cool as the NME,
but not bad. Quite well regarded. And I think after that, he even got a job
working for Marvel._

_I used to go and stay with him sometimes in London, but I kind of lost track
after a while. Anyway, he got a brain aneurysm. He came back to Scotland a
number of years ago and I think he's in a care home._

_The singer from the Bluebells, Ken McCluskey, who we knew, discovered that this
guy Harry Papadopoulos was back in Scotland. And the reason he found out about
it, was because Harry's brother was an electrician or a tradesman of some kind
and went and did a job in this house. The subject must have come up, and he
found out about it. Ken from the Bluebells went to visit him, and they managed
to get a hold of his old negatives. They've been on display in several art
galleries and so forth. And there was a book published._

**There was the “[Rip It Up: The Story of Scottish
Pop](https://www.nms.ac.uk/past-exhibitions/rip-it-up-the-story-of-scottish-pop)”
exhibition at the National Museum of Scotland in 2018, where there were a couple
of things you contributed.**

_I never really collected a lot of memorabilia, but there were some things I
had. Part of the reason for it is that a lot of people in the past have been
asked to lend things of that type and never got them back. Thus a lot of people
who were asked to lend things would say "nah, not doing that". But with the
National Museum of Scotland they were quite reliable, and you did get everything
back. So it ended up being quite extensive._

---

_Occasionally in YouGov questionnaires they'll ask things like "What does
Britain do best?" I'm not saying things like industrial products—I'd say music,
comedy, acting, writing, and the arts in general. And it's hard to think of
things that Britain does better than those kinds of things._

**Aye, a lump of steel, production processes notwithstanding, is fungible no
matter where it's from. But things like music, comedy, et cetera, are such a
specific product of the people and the culture, you can't get that anywhere
else.
**
_For a very long time pop and rock music that was listened to internationally
was almost exclusively from Britain and America. And that has been changing.
There were certain countries, like Germany, that became quite successful, or at
least critically recognised for what they were doing._

**Aye, they weren't playing Kraftwerk on Clyde One initially.**

_No. But there were a lot of other things coming out of Germany at that time,
but it probably remained quite underground, or a niche interest. That's
continued—music from other countries gaining recognition in the UK. And now that
you have K-pop and J-pop, these are massively successful._

**Aye, it’s good to see that things are getting a bit more nuanced than just the
catch-all term of "World Music".**

_Yes, there were phases—African music was a thing for a while, and reggae
especially — Jamaica was close to America which may have helped with discovery
and distribution. It very much had its own sound; and it developed over the
years from ska, blue beat, and reggae, and they had their own version of rap
quite early on._

**And one sees how things like dub and whatnot influenced other musical genres
around the world. I've also been seeing the influence of some of the genres
around Afro-house in recent years.
**
_Africa has so many different countries with their own traditions and own
styles, but certainly around that time they would have had a lot of influence
from what was coming out of Britain and America._

**Yes, they had a lot more access to the mass production and outreach to get their
music heard internationally.**

_A lot of these things are very popular in their own country and there are only
certain ones which go internationally. There are certainly people that can help
give it a boost. Paul Simon recorded an album with African musicians in the
“Graceland” album a number of years ago. And he got a lot of criticism because
South Africa had apartheid going on and there were supposed to be cultural
boycotts._

_However, I think his point was more that “this is the cultural bit and we're
actually paying people quite a lot more than the going rate”; and some of them
got successful careers out of it internationally._

**I also wonder how many of the musicians he was collaborating with were hitting
oot with "I love apartheid, now here's Wonderwall". It could well have been
people that were not okay with the regime.**

_Most of the South African musicians involved were Black artists who had lived
under apartheid and whose careers were constrained by it — but I think the
boycott of South Africa was for the whole country. Therefore, even if you were
working with people who were victims of it, it was still frowned upon in many
ways. That being said, I think Paul Simon was quite a tough guy with a lot of
self-belief, so he just did it anyway._

**This was all well before my time, did it seem like the boycott was a significant
part of how the apartheid came to an end?
**
_Probably yes, but there are lots of factors beyond that._

**Well, thanks for this chat — there are plenty of other threads we could pull on.
For example, the Virgin Megastores opening, or other bits and pieces, people
you've met over the years, or when a random band or a track comes up in
conversation it seems like you're able to bring in some anecdotes just off the
cuff.
**
_I think for certain things I have quite a good memory. There's this common
thing that for some people, there's certain types of music that they liked when
they were in their late teens and that's what they like forever. Whereas I've
always wanted to find new things; and there are some people like that, but I
think that's the minority because you have to put some effort into it, and you
do have to be interested. And if you're interested enough you will remember
these things._

**I think to this day you are probably the main input of interesting new music to
me. I do go out and find stuff on my own but I think it is more through
happenstance rather than getting any magazines just because of the lifestyle I'm
living right now.
**
_I think if you're interested in music quite a lot, it ties in with so many
other things. That would lead you into particular types of books or films or
art. It's all tied together._

**Cheers da!**
