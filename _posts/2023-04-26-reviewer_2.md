Getting close to version 1.0 of my PhD thesis, so I'll soon be roping in colleagues and pals to give some feedback.

But first, I've written a script to give the first round of feedback - automatically.

`reviewer_2.py` is an LLM-based LaTeX document review system (i.e., proofreading "AI", using gpt3.5-turbo). It provides feedback on your writing style and quality, and has some (sketchy) domain knowledge thanks to being trained on the web.

Take its output with a pinch of salt (as you should with any human proofreader), and definitely don't use it to write your papers. However, I've found it to be super-handy in catching issues that my spelling and grammar checkers have not.

I've open sourced the code [here](https://github.com/Wheest/bib-boi), hopefully I'll get a chance to discuss it more once my thesis is done!
