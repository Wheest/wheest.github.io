Thanks to our success in the [AIMDDE project]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2022/01/25/aimdde.html), the [BonsAPPs consortium](https://bonsapps.eu/consortium/) invited [Dr Cano Reyes](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/) and I as keynotes to their ["Matchmaking and Demo Day"](https://bonsapps.eu/event/bonsapps-matchmaking-and-demo-day/).

We highlighted to the audience (of SMEs and AI talents) the value of using effective community driven tooling for developing AI applications, even as researchers, and highlighted some of the key features of our [AccML 2022 paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2022/06/19/accml_workflows.html).
