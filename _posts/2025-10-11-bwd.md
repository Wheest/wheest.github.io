I've been chatting recently with
[Melize Ferrus](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-2067), currently working on
<span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span> PhD in physics and studying
various aspects of gravitational waves.

It's not an area I have much expertise in, but through a series of chats and
playing around with some of <span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span>
code (and making some fun demos), I thought I'd discuss what I've learned. This
is not a deep dive into the physics, but rather an exercise in cross-discipline
communication, and a chance to play with some Python code. I wrap up with a Q&A
to hear <span class="pronoun"
data-type="possessive"></span> take on physics and collaboration.

I've asked Melize to write some clarifications and commentary, which will appear
in block quotes like this:

> What it do, what it does 🥘

The rest of the text is my understanding, and may contain errors. Anything you
see that is wrong is my fault, not Melize's (including quote transcription).
Everything should be prefixed with "I reckon". You can read more about Melize's
work on gravitational waves in
[this article](https://nautil.us/a-supermassive-test-for-einsteins-famous-theory-312691/).

Melize's code is closed source for now while <span class="pronoun"
data-type="subject"></span> works on some active areas of research, but I was
given access to it for this exercise. The [`astropy`](https://www.astropy.org/)
and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) libraries are used extensively.

# The Problem Area

The code that Melize shared with me was looking at binary white dwarf (BWD)
systems. These are pairs of white dwarf stars (which are the cores of dead
stars) orbiting each other.

There are a few reasons why these systems are interesting to study. From what I
gather though, of particular interest is that when these stars get close to each
other, they can produce very small gravitational waves.

> When the white dwarfs get close enough that they become bound and start
> orbiting each other, they emit gravitational waves. We're mostly looking at
> ones inside our own galaxy, because anything further out would be way too
> faint to detect.

It is difficult to detect gravitational waves from such small systems, but the
reason why we care is that they contribute noise, or "background radiation", to
the gravitational wave signals we do care about, such as those from black hole
mergers.

Therefore, understanding these white dwarf systems helps us to better interpret
the gravitational wave data we receive from detectors like
[LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) and
[Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/science/gw-universe/the-first-detections/).

> In my case the work's for LISA — the space-based gravitational wave detector.

> months. That means we can detect black holes long before they merge and
> coordinate with telescopes to watch the same event. It's going to open up a
> lot for cosmology and multi-messenger studies.

So how does Melize's code tackle this problem?

# The Code

I saw that Melize's code had two main parts, both of which use _Gibbs Sampling_.
Gibbs sampling is a statistical technique used to generate samples from a
probability distribution. We don't need to use "real" data points from
astronomical observations, especially with the number of data points we need.
Instead, we can use our models of the Galaxy and the binary white dwarf systems
to generate synthetic data points that are statistically similar to what we
might observe.

> I'd maybe mention it's a Monte Carlo method — Gibbs sampling is just one type
> of that. There are a bunch of approaches; this is the one I happened to use.

The two main uses of Gibbs sampling in <span class="pronoun"
data-type="possessive"></span> code were:

- Drawing samples of what the binary white dwarf systems might look like (e.g.,
  their masses, distances, and orbital periods).
- Generating _where_ in the galaxy these systems might be located.

Boffins have modelled what we think the distribution of these systems looks
like, and this code is drawing samples from this distribution. The specifics of
the distributions are not important for this discussion, and not something I've
taken the time to understand.

> proper joint distribution.

# Binary White Dwarf Systems

When we generate a sample of a binary white dwarf system, we are generating:

- The mass of the first white dwarf (in solar masses).
- The mass of the second white dwarf (in solar masses).
- Their semi-major axis (in solar radii) --- essentially the orbital radius, but
  these orbits aren't circular.
- Their orbital eccentricity (what shape their orbit is).

> Semi-major axis is the halfway point of the furthest distance between the two
> bodies in their orbit.

For example, a sample I generated from Melize's code was:

**Example Binary White Dwarf System**

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_1 &= 1.33\,M_\odot \\
m_2 &= 0.64\,M_\odot \\
e   &= 0.38 \\
a   &= 7.26 \times 10^5\,R_\odot
\end{aligned}
$$
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

To help with my own exploration, I also gave each system a random name using 2
words from the [EFF Long Wordlist](https://www.eff.org/dice).

E.g.,

```
overrun-nicotine
stack-thursday
goldmine-undesired
strained-hurried
ecologist-undead
cherisher-degree
supermom-unsigned
rescuer-sternum
zebra-crepe
```

From this code, we can generate as many samples as we want, and our set of
binary white dwarf systems will be distributed according to our model.

**Melize, what can we do with these samples?**

> What I'm actually computing is the gravitational-wave power contributed by all
> the white dwarfs at each discrete frequency. E.g., using some nonsense numbers
> and units, it might give one million watts at 1 mHz and something else at 10
> mHz. Let's say those are the bands LISA's interferometer is looking at, and
> that helps us correct our observations. That's my focus, though you could use
> the samples for other analyses too.

# Galactic Coordinates

We expect the white dwarf systems to be distributed around the Milky Way galaxy,
with a higher density towards the center of the galaxy, and a lower density as
we move away from the center.

The galaxy is modelled as a disk, with a bulge in the center. Melize's model
generates "2D cylindrical galactic coordinates", which are:

- \(R\): radial distance: the distance from the center of the galaxy.
- \(Z\): the vertical distance above or below the galactic midplane.

> The coordinates are cylindrical — the center of the galaxy's at (0, 0).
> They're distributed to match how main-sequence stars are spread throughout the
> Milky Way. From a logical standpoint they're just dead stars, so BWDs will be
> wherever stars are. I can't think of a strong reason for their distribution to
> be very different.

This is in contrast to the more familiar Cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)`.
However, to convert from galactic coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, we also
need the "azimuthal" angle (φ), which is the angle around the center of the
galaxy. This requires an assumption about how the systems are distributed
_around_ the galaxy. This isn't necessary for Melize's work, but I wanted to
visualise the results in a format I was more familiar with.

Therefore I added a third step to the code, which was to draw a random angle
between `[0, τ]`, and then convert from galactic coordinates to Cartesian ones.
We already have the `Z` coordinate, and we can convert from `(R, φ)` to `(x, y)`
using:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= R \cos(\phi) \\
y &= R \sin(\phi)
\end{aligned}
$$
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> For what I'm doing, you do eventually need the azimuthal angle because you
> need to know where the binary is located relative to the gravitational wave.
> But it's uniform, so there's no need to sample it — it's just drawn uniformly,
> sometimes conditional on other factors.

# Visualisation

With Melize's code, and some minor data transformation, we can now generate
5,000 BWD systems, and also generate their positions in the galaxy. The code is
capable of generating as many samples as we want, but for my purposes I kept the
number small.

This plot is interactive, using the `plotly` library, and its `go.Scatter3d`
tool. I initially made this in a Jupyter notebook, and then exported it to a
format that can run in the browser using Plotly's JavaScript library, using
`fig.write_json("2025-10-binaries.json")`.

```python
# Create an interactive 3D scatter plot of the sampled systems
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(
    go.Scatter3d(
        x=x,
        y=y,
        z=z_vals,
        mode="markers",
        text=hover_text,
        hoverinfo="text",
        marker=dict(
            size=3,
            color=m1_vals,
            colorscale="Turbo",
            colorbar=dict(title="Primary Mass [M☉]", tickcolor="white"),
            opacity=0.8,
        ),
    )
)
```

You can see it below, if your browser supports it.

<div id="binaries_plot" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></div>

If you hover over a point, it will show you the details of that binary white
dwarf system, including the randomly generated name I added.

# Audio Shenanigans

Next, I wanted to do something more playful. Using the generated BWD systems, I
tried out a few techniques to turn them into musical notes. I spent some time
tuning how different parameters influenced the audio.

I've not done much audio programming before, so I kept it simple, using 4 basic
waveform types: sine, square, snare, and kick.

<img src="/assets/pics/2025-10-waves.png" alt="Waveforms" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;margin-bottom:1rem;">
<div id="waves_audio_controls"
     style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:center;gap:1rem;
            margin-bottom:2rem;position:relative;z-index:1;">
  <button onclick="playArray(window.data_sine)">▶ Sine</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(window.data_square)">▶ Square</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(window.data_snare)">▶ Snare</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(window.data_kick)">▶ Kick</button>
</div>

I generated a bunch of BWD samples, and checked the parameter ranges so I could
normalise them.

My code ended up being quite hacky:

```python
def bwd_to_voice(m1, m2, e, a, norm_ranges):
    """Map BWD parameters to sound features and instrument type."""
    nm1, nm2, ne, na = norm_ranges
    mass_avg = (m1 - nm1[0]) / (nm1[1] - nm1[0] + 1e-9)
    ecc = (e - ne[0]) / (ne[1] - ne[0] + 1e-9)
    sep = (a - na[0]) / (na[1] - na[0] + 1e-9)
    q = m2 / m1
    asym = abs(m1 - m2) / m1

    # instrument choice
    if mass_avg > 0.8:
        voice = "kick"
    elif ecc > 0.7:
        voice = "snare"
    elif asym > 0.3:
        voice = "square"
    else:
        voice = "sine"

    freq = 100 + 800 * mass_avg
    dur = 0.2 + 0.8 * (1 - sep)
    vol = 0.3 + 0.7 * ecc
    return freq, dur, vol, voice
```

With a constant BPM, I passed binary white dwarf systems through this code,
making one note each, and generated the following track:

{% raw %}

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;margin:1.5rem 0;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEgBRG2BrM0"
          title="YouTube video player"
          style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0;"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
          allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
{% endraw %}

A tad atonal, which makes sense since we're mapping astronomical parameters to
musical ones without any harmonic constraints. Maybe I need to read more music
theory. However, it grows on me the more I generate and listen to it.

Perhaps it's hubris to think that randomly generated white dwarf systems would
immediately make good music, but it's fun to try.

# Q&A

Now that I've shown some of my hacking around with Melize's code, here I take
the opportunity to ask <span class="pronoun" data-type="object"></span> some
general questions.

**What got you interested in this area of research?**

**What are some big open questions in this area of research that you're
interested in?**

**You deal with some pretty large simulations and computations. Would you say
that programming is a big part of your work? Is there enough collaboration
between physicists and computer experts?**

> Yeah, programming's a big part of it. But I'd say most physicists are computer

> We're not computer experts broadly.
>
> Like, you [ed: Perry] know enough physics to help me out with something, but
> not enough physics overall to anticipate what I might need. Same for me—I know
> enough computational stuff to get results, but I don't always follow the best

**Amongst other things, you're black, and present pretty femme, which is still
relatively rare in physics. Have you had any interesting or noteworthy
experiences through this lens?**

**What are the biggest uncertainties in the models you work with?**

**Thank you Melize.**

# Conclusions

When I talk to specialists in other fields who are articulate and passionate
about their work, I find it infectious. I usually come away with the feeling of
"ah, so it _isn't magic_, but _it is_ hard". I haven't eaten my intellectual
vegetables by working through general-relativity textbook exercises. However, by
inhabiting Melize's code for a while, and picking
<span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span> brain, I feel like I've
gained a little more appreciation of the field, and the cool people that work in
it.
