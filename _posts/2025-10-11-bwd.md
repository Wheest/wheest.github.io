> Under construction

I've recently been chatting with [Melize Ferrus](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-2067), currently working on <span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span> PhD in
astrophysics, studying the dynamics of black hole mergers.

It's not an area I have much expertise in, but through a series of chats, and
playing around with some of <span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span> code (making some fun
demos), I thought I'd discuss what I've learned.
This is not a deep dive into the physics, but rather an exercise in
cross-discipline communication, and a chance to play with some Python code. I
wrap up with a Q&A to hear <span class="pronoun"
data-type="possessive"></span> take on physics and collaboration.

<!--more-->

I've asked Melize to write some clarifications and corrections, which will
appear in block quotes like this.

> Hi there, I'm Melize

The rest of the text is my understanding, and may contain errors. Anything you
see that is wrong is my fault, not Melize's. Everything should be prefixed with
"I reckon". You can read more about Melize's work on gravitational waves in
[this
article](https://nautil.us/a-supermassive-test-for-einsteins-famous-theory-312691/).

Melize's code is closed source for now while <span class="pronoun"
data-type="subject"></span> work on some active areas of research, but I was
given access to it for this exercise.
The [`astropy`](https://www.astropy.org/) and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
libraries are used extensively.

# The Problem Area

The code that Melize has been working with is looking at binary
white dwarf (BWD) systems. These are pairs of white dwarf stars (which are the cores
of dead stars, around the mass of our sun) orbiting each other.

There are a few reasons why these systems are interesting to study. From what I
gather though, under particular interest is that when these stars get close to
each other, they can produce very small gravitational waves.

> Melize here:

It is difficult to detect gravitational waves from such small systems, but the
reason why we care is that they contribute noise, or "background radiation", to
the gravitational wave signals we care about, such as those from black hole mergers.

Therefore, understanding these white dwarf systems helps us to better interpret
the gravitational wave data we receive from detectors like LIGO and Virgo.

> Melize again:

# The Code

I saw that Melize's code had two main parts, both of which using "Gibbs
Sampling".
Gibbs sampling is a statistical technique used to generate samples from a
probability distribution.

> Melize, what is Gibbs sampling?

The two main parts were:

- Drawing samples of what the binary white dwarf systems might look like
  (e.g. their masses, distances, and orbital periods).
- Generating _where_ in the galaxy these systems might be located.

Boffins have modelled what we think the distribution of these systems looks like, and
what this code is doing is drawing samples from this distribution.
The specifics of the distributions are not important for this discussion, and
not something I've taken the time to understand.

> Melize, can you explain the distributions?

# Binary White Dwarf Systems

When we generate a sample of a binary white dwarf system, we are generating:

- The mass of the first white dwarf (in solar masses).
- The mass of the second white dwarf (in solar masses).
- Their orbital separation (in solar radii).
- Their orbital eccentricity (what shape their orbit is).

For example, a sample I generated from Melize's code was:

**Example Binary White Dwarf System**

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_1 &= 1.33\,M_\odot \\
m_2 &= 0.64\,M_\odot \\
e   &= 0.38 \\
a   &= 7.26 \times 10^5\,R_\odot
\end{aligned}
$$
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

To help with my own exploration, I also gave each system a random name, using 2 words from the [EFF Long
Wordlist](https://www.eff.org/dice).

E.g.,

```
overrun-nicotine
stack-thursday
goldmine-undesired
strained-hurried
ecologist-undead
cherisher-degree
supermom-unsigned
rescuer-sternum
zebra-crepe
```

From this code, we can generate as many samples as we want, and our set of
binary white dwarf systems will be distributed according to our model.

> Melize, what can we do with these samples?

# Galactic Coordinates

We expect the white dwarf systems to be distributed around the Milky Way galaxy,
with a higher density towards the center of the galaxy, and a lower density as
we move away from the center.

The galaxy is modelled as a disk, with a bulge in the center. The model that
Melize uses "cylindrical galactic coordinates", which are:

- \(R\): Galactocentric radial distance: the distance from the center of the
  galaxy.
- \(Z\): the vertical distance above or below the galactic midplane.

This is in contrast to the more familiar cartesian coordinates `(x, y, z)`.
However, to convert from galactic coordinates to cartesian coordinates, we also
need the "azimuthal" angle (φ), which is the angle around the center of the
galaxy. This requires an assumption about how the systems are distributed _around_ the galaxy.
This isn't necessary for Melize's work, but I wanted to visualise the results in
a format I was more familiar with.

Therefore I added a third step to the code, which was to draw a random angle
between `[0, τ]`, and then convert from galactic coordinates to cartesian ones.
We already have the `Z` coordinate, and we can convert from `(R, φ)` to `(x, y)`
using:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= R \cos(\phi) \\
y &= R \sin(\phi)
\end{aligned}
$$
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> Melize, thoughts on this:?

# Visualisation

Now, with Melize's code, and some minor data transformation, we can now generate
5,000 BWD systems, and also generate their positions in the galaxy. The code is
capable of generating as many samples as we want, but for my purposes I kept the
number small.

This plot is interactive, using the `plotly` library, and its `go.Scatter3d`
tool.
I initially made this in a Jupyter notebook, and then exported
it to a format that can run in the browser using `plotly`'s JavaScript library, using
`fig.write_json("2025-10-binaries.json")`.

```python
# Create an interactive 3D scatter plot of the sampled systems
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(
    go.Scatter3d(
        x=x,
        y=y,
        z=z_vals,
        mode="markers",
        text=hover_text,
        hoverinfo="text",
        marker=dict(
            size=3,
            color=m1_vals,
            colorscale="Turbo",
            colorbar=dict(title="Primary Mass [M☉]", tickcolor="white"),
            opacity=0.8,
        ),
    )
)
```

You can see it below, if your browser supports it.

<div id="binaries_plot" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></div>

If you hover over a point, it will show you the details of that binary white
dwarf system, including the randomly generated name I added.

# Audio Shenanigans

Next, I wanted to do something more playful. Using the generated BWD systems, I
tried out a few techniques to turn them into musical notes. I spent some time
tuning how different parameters influenced the audio.

There were 4 musical note styles I generated:

<div id="waves_plot" style="width:100%;height:400px;"></div>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;margin-top:10px">
  <button onclick="playArray(data_sine)">▶ Sine</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(data_square)">▶ Square</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(data_snare)">▶ Snare</button>
  <button onclick="playArray(data_kick)">▶ Kick</button>
</div>

# Q&A

Now that I've shown some of my hacking around with Melize's code, here I take
the opportunity to ask <span class="pronoun" data-type="object"></span> some general
questions.

**What got you interested in this area of research?**

> Honestly, nothing in particular. I always wanted to be an astronomer as a kid. At some point I realized I liked physics, so I thought astrophysics would be cool.
>
> But I didn't really know how to read my college website properly, so I didn't realize they didn't even have astronomy. I knew they had physics, but I didn't check the course list well enough. Once I was there, I realized—oh, there's nothing astronomy-related here.
>
> I got involved in aerospace engineering stuff for a bit, then kind of gave up and moved on. Later, I heard about an internship at the Flatiron Institute for people in the National Society for Black Physicists. I applied, got sent a list of different research topics, and picked my top three. The one I ended up doing was literally my lowest-ranked choice.
>
> I think my top pick was something about solar oscillations, and the second one I forget. But yeah, I ended up getting the third one, and over the course of the internship I realized I really liked it. So there was no grand plan like, "I've always wanted to work on black holes." It just kind of happened.

**What are some big open questions in this area of research that you're interested in.**

> I work across a pretty wide range of things in gravitational waves. What I'm doing now is different from what I did with at Flatiron, and different again from what I did at King's.
>
> On the numerical relativity side, one big question is whether we can come up with a model or theorem that works for the merger phase of black hole collisions. We already have post-Newtonian approximations for the inspiral, and quasi-normal modes for the ringdown. Those let you predict what the gravitational wave looks like if you know the parameters of the system.
>
> But for that last bit, right before the black holes coalesce, there's no theorem—just heavy computation. It would be great if we had a simpler equation or model instead of running six-hour-long simulations for that one stage.
>
> Then there's eccentricity. Black hole mergers can have different eccentricities, and that changes the whole signal. But those effects can look like other things—spin, non-vacuum conditions, whatever. So it's hard to tell what's what. We usually assume circular orbits, but they're often not. Understanding the typical black hole orbit better would help a lot—both for improving models and for things like star formation studies.
>
> For the LISA mission, a huge open question is what we'll learn about cosmology. LIGO only catches the last second or so of a merger. LISA will detect black holes a month in advance. That means you can get detailed parameters early, subtract out the known signals, and study what's left—possibly signs of inflation, cosmic strings, or first-order phase transitions. The future looks really exciting for cosmology.

**You deal with some pretty large simulations and computations.
Would you say that programming is a big part of your work?
Is there enough collaboration between physicists and computer experts?**

> Yeah, programming's a big part of it. But I'd say most physicists are computer experts only in the sense that they know enough to make their own stuff work. We're not computer experts broadly.
>
> Like, you [ed: Perry] know enough physics to help me out with something, but not enough physics overall to anticipate what I might need. Same for me—I know enough computational stuff to get results, but I don't always follow the best practices. Someone else could look at my code and think, "Sure, it works, but this could be done way better."
>
> There could definitely be more collaboration. Everyone's under pressure to produce results quickly, so code often ends up written in brute-force, opaque ways. Later, when new people join, they spend weeks just figuring out what the code even does. Half of it could've been explained in a docstring or wiki.
>
> A lot of scientific code isn't open source. That really limits reproducibility and collaboration. Sometimes groups hoard code to keep control—people have to email them to run a simulation instead of doing it themselves. Then those teams rack up citations for just pressing run. Nothing's truly replicable because others can't see the underlying code.
>
> I've even been on papers where the authors said they were using the "highly
> precise [system] code." But how do you know it's precise? You've never seen the
> infrastructure. Everyone assumes it's right because a big name's attached. It's
> very anti-scientific—this blind trust that something's correct just because of
> who made it.

**Amongst other things, you're black, and present pretty femme, which is still pretty rare in physics.
Have you had any interesting or noteworthy experiences through this lens?**

> I've got a few specific examples, but I don't want to call anyone out.
>
> I get mistaken for other people a lot, even at conferences. It happens so often it's almost funny, except it's not.
>
> Like, once at a conference, I asked in the group chat if anyone had painkillers because I had cramps. A guy brought me one, fine. The next day, he said he'd seen "me" while biking and shouted, "Do you still need the drugs?"—but it was just some random woman with similar hair. He figured that must be me.
>
> I've also been to plenty of conferences where no one sits with me. Literally,
> people will fill every seat around me but not next to me. It feels isolating.
>
> It's not that anyone's openly rude. It's just that constant, quiet exclusion.
> Seeing your peers welcomed while you're sidelined makes you ask why. It's
> tiring.

**What are the biggest uncertainties in the models you work with?**

> Oh, huge ones. One of the biggest is the merger rate—how many mergers happen per year. The uncertainty can be as large as the value itself.
>
> Let's me bring up one of my favorite ones. It's very entertaining to me

> [Here we go: neutron star mergers [page 26]](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.031040). The estimated rate is 920 per gigaparsec
> cubed per year, with a +2,220 / –790 margin!
>
> Hands down that's my favourite, I roll around in my non-existent grave to this
> shit. It's a couple of years old, so newer
> estimates are probably tighter now.
> This is for the first two observations of LIGO with the neutron star detection for the collision rate.
>
> Yeah, I have a lot of confidence in all of the different things I generate
> using those kinds of things...

**Anything else you want to say?**

> I really like the kind of work I do. I've been lucky to move between institutions and completely change up what I'm working on each time.
>
> After my year at Flatiron I felt like, "I run this bitch," but when I got to King's it was like starting from scratch again. It's cool seeing how much undergrad material—stuff I once thought was useless—actually shows up all the time.
>
> In undergrad, you're rushing to master something in 13 weeks, then it leaks
> out of your head. Doing a PhD gives you the time to actually learn it
> properly. None of my physics education was a waste. Even the quantum mechanics
> I thought I'd never need has ended up being useful.

> It gives you time to learn the thing properly, as opposed to learn the thing in order to pass the test.
> Yeah, so like if you didn't do everything perfectly in your undergrad, it's
> fine. I think it's just that doing a PhD gives you more appreciation,

**Thank you Melize.**

> Thank you Dr Gibson, I'll see you on GitHub 🙂‍↕️.

# Conclusions

When I talk to specialists in other fields, when they are articulate and
passionate about their work, I find it infectious.
I usually come away with the feeling of "ah, so it _isn't magic_, but _it is_ hard".
I haven't eaten my intellectual vegetables here of doing the exercises of
general relativity textbooks, but by inhabiting Melize's code for a while, and
picking <span class="pronoun" data-type="possessive"></span> brain, I feel like I've gained a little more
appreciation of the field.
