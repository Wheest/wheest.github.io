In this post, I am pleased to announce that I have received a certificate for
completing the
[Google Project Management course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management),
comprised of six modules over six months. Although I have gained significant
experienced in managing projects during my time at
[gicLAB](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/), as well as my other professional
endeavours, I felt that re-familiarising myself with the terminology and best
practices of the field would serve me well. You can find my certificate of
completion [here](https://coursera.org/share/62136e90fbf8f49bfb90f805712fc11c).

Outcomes: I was able to apply these skills for developing grant proposals during
my time at gicLAB.

- I was instrumental in developing gicLAB's contribution to the
  [dAIedge](https://daiedge.eu/) consortium application to the EU, which was
  awarded over 14 million euros. I applied techniques from the course to ensure
  that our planned contributions were achievable and well documented.
- I elected to not continue with a post-doc with gicLAB, and thus had to plan
  out the project in more detail for a new start. This required me translating a
  lot of my institutional and project knowledge into additional documentation to
  help them. For example, a stakeholder management plan, and a more detailed
  task breakdown.
