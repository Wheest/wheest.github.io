In this post, I am pleased to announce that I have received a certificate for completing the [Google Project Management course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management), comprised of six modules over six months.
Although I have gained significant experienced in managing projects during my time at [gicLAB](giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/), as well as my other professional endeavours, I felt that re-familiarising myself with the terminology and best practices of the field would serve me well.
You can find my certificate of completion [here](https://coursera.org/share/62136e90fbf8f49bfb90f805712fc11c).

Outcomes: I was able to apply these skills for developing grant proposals during my time at gicLAB.

- I was instrumental in developing gicLAB's contribution to the [dAIedge](https://daiedge.eu/) consortium application to the EU, which was awarded over 14 million euros.  I applied techniques from the course to ensure that our planned contributions were achievable and well document.
- I elected to not continue with a post-doc with gicLAB, and thus had to plan out the project in more detail for a new start.  This required me translating a lot of my institutional and project knowledge into additional documentation to help them.  For example, a stakeholder management plan, and a more detailed task breakdown.
