I'm visiting the NUCAR lab, at Northeastern University, Boston.
I'm working on a short project, exploring fully-homomorphic encryption compilers using MLIR.
Meeting lots of interesting folk, eating great food, and getting into the Boston frame of mind.

Many thanks to the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scottish-informatics-and-computer-science-alliance-sicsa-/) for providing some of the funding!
