My research group, [Glasgow Intelligent Computing Lab (gicLAB)](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk), was awarded a â‚¬28k grant as part of the [BonsAPPs](https://bonsapps.eu/) AI industry challenge.
I was one of the writers of the grant, and now am pausing my studies for 2 months to be the technical lead on the project.

The overall goal of the challenge is to produce AI models which can effectively detect defects in manufactured goods (e.g., rolled steel, or textiles), and deploy them in a constrained edge device (e.g., Nvidia AGX Xavier).
