This post is the fourth in my DNN64 series, where I discuss my project of
compiling and accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) on the Nintendo 64 system
using modern tools and techniques. My first post is available
[here]({% post_url 2024-03-12-dnn64_p1 %}), and the goal is to use modern tools
and techniques on this constrained platform. This post discusses the N64's
co-processor, the RSP, which I am using to accelerate my DNN computations.

The N64's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) was kind of ahead of its time as a
graphics processor. Although other machines were beginning to include dedicated
chips for graphics acceleration, the RSP stood apart as being truly general
purpose. By that, I mean that instead of processing using a small set of fixed
functions, it has a full instruction set programmed using assembly. Its
acceleration came from the vector unit, which is a MIPS core with vector
instructions (128-bit lanes, with each of the 8 lanes being 16-bits wide). There
is also a scalar unit which can execute simultaneously (assuming there aren't
data hazards), although its instruction set is significantly reduced.

One of the reasons why the project is appealing to me is that this high-level
system design, of a CPU with a co-processor with more limited memory, is very
similar to modern DNN accelerator environments (CPU+GPU/TPU/etc). Therefore,
many of the design decisions and trade-offs that we will make on this "old"
platform are similar to the kind of ones we might make in modern ones. Namely,
how do we fit computations that are too large onto it, balancing the performance
considerations of the cost of sending and receiving data, and the fact that we
can do work on the CPU at the same time.

Sure, the N64 hardware is old, but these are the same problems I've faced in
others works using modern hardware, e.g.,
[the SECDA project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jpdc.2022.11.005) (led by
the talented hardware systems designer Jude Haris). Moreover, we're using modern
software tooling, so the retro nature of the N64 is almost irrelevant, it's just
in terms of resources it's now closer to a contemporary micro-controller.

#### Kicking it 90s style

One of the first steps I took when looking into this accelerator was to
[rtfm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM), if you can believe it. The
[RSP manual is available here](https://ultra64.ca/files/documentation/silicon-graphics/SGI_Nintendo_64_RSP_Programmers_Guide.pdf),
released in 1996, which I used to both gain some insights into the RSP's design
and behaviour; as well as some historical interest.

Let's take a couple of excerpts that stood out to me, more on an aesthetic level
than a technical one:

For example:

Youch, that doesn't bode well!

Half a billion arithmetic operations per second! Can you believe it. For
reference, 2019's NVidia 3090 can do like five orders of magnitude more!
Although to be fair, both the RSP and the 3090 leave my ability to do mental
maths in the dust

This next quote gives information about performance optimization of RSP
programs, but also highlights the main designer of the RSP was someone called
Mary Jo Doherty.

She seems to have a had a
[pretty illustrious career](https://hfischer.com/hfa-assists-cadence-design-systems-in-placing-mary-jo-doherty-as-vp-of-engineering-hardware-systems-verification/),
at organisations such as Silicon Graphics (where the RSP was developed), Sun
Microsystems, Transmeta Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, Oracle, and
SambaNova. Cheers Mary Jo!

Finally, for you hardware-heads, here's some concise info:

> The RSP has a vector processor, implemented as MIPS Coprocessor. The vector
> unit (VU) has 32 128-bit wide vector registers (which can also be accessed as
> 8 vector slices), a vector accumulator (which also has 8 vector slices), and
> several special-purpose vector control registers. The VU instruction set
> includes all useful computational instructions (add, multiply, logical,
> reciprocal, etc.) plus additional “multimedia instructions” which are well
> suited for graphics and audio processing. These instructions are thoroughly
> explained in Chapter 3, “Vector Unit Instructions”.

> Pipeline depth varies among MIPS processors and their implementations. The RSP
> has a pipeline depth of 5.

As discussed earlier, the RSP is programmed in assembly, and with a decent
enough manual like this, it should be possible to get our accelerated DNN layers
implemented this way. However, writing assembly can be time consuming, and
optimizing it has the issue of making it very difficult to parse, especially
after multiple passes of optimization strategies like instruction reordering. In
principle, I could write this assembly myself, like my forebears did, but I'm
not sure if this is the kind of guy I want to become.

This is one of the many motivations for using a compiler --- write your code in
a more readable high-level language, and let the compiler handle the generation
and optimization of the assembly.

Since LLVM can generate MIPS code, I considered making some alterations
specifically for the RSP. However, this ended up not being necessary because I
found as of October 2023, someone is making a DSL (domain-specific language) and
optimising compiler for the RSP: [RSPL](https://mbeboek.gitlab.io/rspl/)!

### RSPL: Really Saves Perry's Lardon 🥓

I've been building up a repository of examples of RSPL, which I've released
under an MIT License [on my GitHub](https://github.com/Wheest/rspl_examples/).
I'll discuss some of these examples more in a future post when I talk about
accelerating DNN computations.

You can see some annotated examples below, which I encourage you to copy-paste
into the [RSPL web-app](https://mbeboek.gitlab.io/rspl/) to see the assembly it
generates. Experiment with turning optimization and re-ordering on and off to
see its impact:

**Add one to a list of 8 values**

```js
state
{
  // Allocate space for our data
  vec16 DATA[1];
}

command<0> AddOne(u32 addrData)
{
  // first byte of first arg has metadata
  // that needs to be dropped
  addressMatC &= 0xFFFFFF;

  // Perform DMA from CPU into RSP mem
  dma_in(DATA, addrData);

  // vec16 is a vector type, with 8 16-bit elements
  // Here we load from RSP mem into a vector register
  vec16 d = load(DATA, 0x00);

  d += 1; // Add one to every element (SIMD instruction)

  // Store register in RSP mem
  store(d, DATA, 0x00);

  // Return data to CPU over DMA
  dma_out(DATA, addrData);
}

```

**Reduction of a list of 8 values (sum is stored in idx 0)**

```js
command<0> Reduction(u32 addressMatC)
{
  addressMatC &= 0xFFFFFF;

  // Perform DMA for input
  dma_in(INPUT, addressMatC);

  // Load value into register
  vec16 psum = load(INPUT, 0x00);

  // Use swizzle syntax to get sum
  // first value is the sum, rest are junk
  psum += psum.yywwYYWW;
  psum += psum.zzzzZZZZ;
  psum += psum.X;
  store(psum, INPUT, 0x00);

  dma_out(INPUT, addressMatC);
}
```

### Conclusions

This post gave a quick overview of the Reality Signal Processor (RSP), the main
accelerator in the N64. We discussed a little bit about its architecture
(128-bit 8 lane vector instructions), as well as how we can program it. Future
posts will discuss how we can accelerate DNN computations using it.
