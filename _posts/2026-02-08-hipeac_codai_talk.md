I was delighted to be invited to give a talk and participate in the panel
discussion at the [CODAI workshop](https://www.codai-workshop.com/home)
(Workshop on Compilers, Deployment, and Tooling for AI) at HiPEAC 2026 (Kraków,
Poland).

The talk was titled "The Compiler Before The Horse: Design Space Exploration at
Fractile". There, I discussed how working on the compiler early in our hardware
design process has been crucial for us to explore the design space effectively
and make informed decisions.
