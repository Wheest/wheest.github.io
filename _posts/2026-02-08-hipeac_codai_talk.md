I was delighted to be invited to give a talk and participate in the panel
discussion at the [CODAI workshop](https://www.codai-workshop.com/home)
(Workshop on Compilers, Deployment, and Tooling for AI) at HiPEAC 2026 (Kraków,
Poland).

My talk, titled “The Compiler Before the Horse: Design Space Exploration at
Fractile,” focused on how investing in compiler development early in our
hardware design process has been essential for effective design space
exploration and for making well-informed architectural decisions.
