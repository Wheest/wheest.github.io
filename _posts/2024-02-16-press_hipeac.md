I'm pleased to say that I have been featured in issue 71 of the HiPEAC Info magazine, [available here from the HiPEAC website](https://www.hipeac.net/news/#/magazine/).  You can find it on pages 48-49.  During the interview with a HiPEAC team member, I had the opportunity to discuss my PhD journey, share some of the techniques I developed, and offer insights that could be beneficial to current and prospective PhD candidates.
