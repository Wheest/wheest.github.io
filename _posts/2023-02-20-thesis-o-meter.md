I'll be starting hardcore thesis writing in a month or so.  For measurement and motivation reasons, I've been advised to keep track of progress (e.g. word count added per day).  Therefore, I have open sourced a "thesis-o-meter" tool, which I hope will help me.

<https://github.com/Wheest/thesis-o-meter>

There a few other metrics and analysis tools that I'll add to it as time goes on, however if anyone else wants to use or improve it, feel free.

The [README](https://github.com/Wheest/thesis-o-meter) has a roadmap, as well as system critique.
