My work on [Robot Burns](https://www.robotburns.com/) (my GPT-2 generated poetry pamphlet, in the style of Robert Burns - available for sale at [robotburns.com](https://www.robotburns.com/) ðŸ˜‰) was recently featured in an article on the SC21 (International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis) blog.

The blog was written by [Cristin Merritt](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/author/cristin-merritt/), and can be [read here](https://sc21.supercomputing.org/2021/06/08/robot-burns-using-hpc-to-create-modern-day-poems-inspired-by-18th-century-master/).

I discuss how low cost causal HPC environments like Google Colab have been a boon to hobbyists and artists.
