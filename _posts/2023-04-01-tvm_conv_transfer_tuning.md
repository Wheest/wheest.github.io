I was delighted to be accepted as a speaker at
[TVMCon2023](https://www.tvmcon.org/), presenting my work on
[Transfer-Tuning](https://gibsonic.org/blog/2022/10/12/transfer-tuning.html).
The whole event was great, with
[over 1000 registrants, and 60 speakers](https://octoml.ai/blog/tvmcon-2023-recap/).
My talk was recorded, and is available
[here on the OctoML YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/gRIjSadjbHc).
