I was honoured to be invited to give a talk at the [Alces Flight
2025](https://alces.network/flight-2025/) conference, which took place in
London, UK, in October 2025.

My talk discussed how interdisciplinary collaboration and playfulness can be
powerful tools, especially for early-career researchers and engineers.

I shared some of my experiences from my PhD and industry work.
