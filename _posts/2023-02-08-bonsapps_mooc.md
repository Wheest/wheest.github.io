[Dr Cano Reyes](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~josecr/) and I were invited to
produce an online course (MOOC) for the
[BonsAPPs consortium](https://bonsapps.eu/). Off the back of our [AccML paper on
reproducible workflows for
AI]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2022/06/19/accml_workflows.html), and the AIMDDE
project, and [our invited keynote in
Madrid]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/06/30/madrid_keynote.html) on the topic, they
thought that we would be good advocates to motivate and demonstrate how SMEs can
accelerate their AI application development using AI Assets.

Topics touched upon include cookiecutter-style project templating, dataset
processing reproducibility, continuous integration and deployment,
containerisation, training, benchmarking, cross-framework exporting, and
optimization (e.g., via quantisation).

You can find the MOOC here at <https://learn.bonsapps.eu/>.
