When I joined [Dr Jose Cano Reyes' research
group](https://giclab.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) at the University of Glasgow in 2019, our focus was on the performance of deep learning workloads on
heterogeneous edge devices.

One of my responsibilities was to set up a "device zoo" of edge devices.
We had a range of devices, from Raspberry Pi 3s to NVIDIA Jetson Nanos, and I
had to find a way to manage them all.

3D printed cases were a common solution, but I wanted something more flexible
and modular. I decided to use LEGO bricks to create a stack of devices that
could be easily rearranged and expanded as needed.

I purchased a large set of LEGO bricks 2nd hand from [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page).
