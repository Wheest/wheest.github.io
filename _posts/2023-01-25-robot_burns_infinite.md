For Burns' Night 2023, I am pleased to announce `Robot Burns Infinite`, the follow-up to [2020's Robot Burns]({{ site.baseurl }}/nlp/art/2021/06/08/sc_robot_burns.html)!

Robot Burns Infinite is a website that uses a GPT-3 derived model, trained on 6000 lines of Burns poetry, and will generate new ones on demand.  Buy some credits to get started, and as before all proceed go to Samaritans.

Check out the site at [robotburnsinfinite.com](https://robotburnsinfinite.com), with a brief technical [write-up here](https://robotburnsinfinite.com/technical_info).  I used the Flask Python framework for the website, with a SQL database, AWS for hosting, with Cloudflare for DNS resolution and DDoS mitigation.

Robot Burns Infinite was featured in articles on [The Scotsman](https://www.scotsman.com/heritage-and-retro/heritage/burns-night-robot-burns-and-the-verse-that-keeps-writing-beyond-the-bards-grave-3999868) and [MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/burns-night-robot-burns-and-the-verse-that-keeps-writing-beyond-the-bards-grave/ar-AA16Ht2q?crc=true&cvid=5f78301443e6447188aad8eac8b2479e).
