I was delighted to have our paper "Productive Reproducible Workflows for DNNs: A Case Study for Industrial Defect Detection" accepted in the [AccML 2022](https://accml.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) workshop at the [HiPEAC 2022 conference](https://www.hipeac.net/2022/budapest/#/), where I was first author.
You can view the paper on [arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09359).
I presented a 20 minute presentation on the paper in-person.

The paper came from our successful completion of the [AIMDDE project](https://gibsonic.org/blog/2022/01/25/aimdde.html), where we developed an AI-based solution to industrial defect detection.
We were a small team, with one developer (me) and one project lead, thus we had to be as efficient as possible to achieve our goals.
I exploited the [Bonseyes toolchain](https://beta.bonseyes.com/doc/index.html) and systems such as Docker and high-level domain-specific ML libraries to be highly productive, as well as reproducible.
The paper evangelises the value of these workflows for research and SMEs, by using our experience with AIMDDE as a case-study.
