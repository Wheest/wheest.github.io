I was delighted to have our paper "Productive Reproducible Workflows for DNNs: A
Case Study for Industrial Defect Detection" accepted in the
[AccML 2022](https://accml.dcs.gla.ac.uk/) workshop at the
[HiPEAC 2022 conference](https://www.hipeac.net/2022/budapest/#/), where I was
first author. You can view the paper on
[arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09359). I presented a 20 minute
presentation on the paper in-person.

The paper came from our successful completion of the
[AIMDDE project](https://gibsonic.org/blog/2022/01/25/aimdde.html), where we
developed an AI-based solution to industrial defect detection. We were a small
team, with one developer (me) and one project lead, thus we had to be as
efficient as possible to achieve our goals. I exploited the
[Bonseyes toolchain](https://beta.bonseyes.com/doc/index.html) and systems such
as Docker and high-level domain-specific ML libraries to be highly productive,
as well as reproducible. The paper evangelises the value of these workflows for
research and SMEs, by using our experience with AIMDDE as a case-study.
