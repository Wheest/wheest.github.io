I've just released a new open-source project called **Petit Pois**, [available on my GitHub](https://github.com/Wheest/petit-pois), written in Python.

It's a podcast archive tool and feed generator that allows you to archive podcast episodes and generate custom feeds for them. The project is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on flexibility and customisation. I have a sketch of a workflow for how we can generate private token URLs, and integrate it with a web server such as Nginx to serve the files.

Most podcasts are shite, but it's still important that we have archival tools available, since _some_ of them may be important to preserve for future generations.

The main goal is for personal archival, preservation, and research use only, as redistributing or republishing podcast episodes without permission may be illegal. Big ol' disclaimer: I encourage users to respect the rights of content creators and follow copyright laws.
